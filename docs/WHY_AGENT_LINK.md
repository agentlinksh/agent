# Why Agent Link?

## The Name

"Agent Link" works on two levels. It's the link between agents and successful outcomes on Supabase. And it's a reference to Link — the hero from *The Legend of Zelda*.

## The Inspiration

In *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*, Link starts with nothing. The world is vast and open, but without the Sheikah Slate and its runes, he can't meaningfully interact with it. Each rune is a focused ability — Magnesis, Stasis, Cryonis — that doesn't limit the open world but makes it *usable*.

Agent Link works the same way. Supabase is powerful and flexible. But without opinionated patterns, agents can't navigate that flexibility reliably. Each domain in Agent Link is a composable ability that equips your agent to build correctly — not by limiting what it can do, but by making sure it does it right.

## The Metaphor

| Zelda | Agent Link |
|-------|-----------|
| The Sheikah Slate | Agent Link (the project) |
| Runes | Skills |
| Link | Your agent |
| Hyrule | Supabase |

The Sheikah Slate doesn't make Hyrule smaller. It gives Link the abilities to navigate it with confidence. That's what Agent Link does for agents building on Supabase.

## The Character: Link Smith

Our mascot is Link reimagined as Agent Smith from *The Matrix*. A hero who acquired powerful abilities, now dressed in the sharp, no-nonsense uniform of someone who enforces order in a chaotic system.

- Link's silhouette and proportions (pointed ears, adventurer build)
- Agent Smith's wardrobe: black suit, black tie, white dress shirt, dark sunglasses
- The Sheikah Slate on his hip instead of a holster
- Subtle green digital rain reflections in his sunglasses
- Calm, competent, slightly dry humor — the guide you trust, not the boss you fear

## This is Our Way

Agent Link doesn't give you options. It gives you answers.

Not because there's only one way to build on Supabase — there are many. But because there should be one clear path that leads to something solid.

One set of patterns. One philosophy. One way to build.
